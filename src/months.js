    month: "#1: Nirvana's 'Nevermind' is the second studio album by American rock band Nirvana, released on September 24, 1991, by DGC Records. A number of labels courted the band, but Nirvana ultimately signed with Geffen Records imprint DGC Records based upon repeated recommendations from Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth and their management company. Produced by Butch Vig, it was the band's first release on the label, as well as the first to feature drummer Dave Grohl. The album cover, which shows a naked baby swimming with a U.S. dollar bill on a fishhook just out of his reach, is often recognized as one of the most famous album covers in popular music.",
